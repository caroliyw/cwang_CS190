 These were some of the projects that I created for CS190: Computer Music Programming at UCI. \
 The class aimed to introduce students to musical programming concepts, the physics of sound, and innovations in music performance technology. 
 
 In order to fully interact with any assignment that includes a ".maxpat" file, 
 you will need to install and subscribe to Cycling 74's Max programming language and environment (Download [here](https://cycling74.com/products/max/))
 
 Assignment 2 is the only project that does not use MAX (it was implemented using HTML/CSS/JS).
 
 More information about each assignment can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/uci.edu/cyw-comp-music)
